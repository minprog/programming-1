# Course components

You're on your own through this course most of the time, though we will be, quite literally, on your side when you're in the labs. Make good use of the various materials that are in the course. Here's a guided tour through the important parts.

## Lectures

These discuss all theory that is needed to pass the quizzes. Watch the lectures before or on your way to the lab sessions, in order to be able to spend your lab time programming and asking questions.

## Walkthroughs

Integrated into problem sets are "walkthroughs," videos via which the course's staff offer direction on where to begin and how to approach a challenge. You are expected to watch walkthroughs while starting with your problem sets.

## Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 60-minute sections led by the teaching fellows. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course's material in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and a group of classmates present, as well as to dive into hands-on activities.

## Office Hours

Office hours are opportunities for assistance with problem sets alongside the
course's teaching assistants. Office hours ordinarily take place from 1PM to 5PM on Mondays through Fridays.

## Tutoring

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still
find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible,
providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one
or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads (shoot a question at the top of this site).

## Problem Sets

Five problem sets are assigned during the course. Each is due by a pre-set deadline: Friday, at noon. Lateness of electronic submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to submitting twenty-four hours late. Late work is not ordinarily accepted, except in cases of medical emergency.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit outright. When determining grades at term's end, however, we do bear in mind submissions of Hacker Editions.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the two.

Although you must submit all five problem sets, your lowest score among those problem sets on which you received a perfect score for the axis of scope will be dropped when final grades are determined.

## Quiz

The course has one 75-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.
