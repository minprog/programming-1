# Course components

You're on your own through this course most of the time, though we will be, quite literally, on your side when you're in the labs. Make good use of the various materials that are in the course. Here's a guided tour through the important parts.

## Lectures

These discuss all theory that is needed to pass the quizzes. Watch the lectures before or on your way to the lab sessions, in order to be able to spend your lab time programming and asking questions.

## Problem Sets

The 7 problem sets and the final project are the hard work of the course, on which you will spend most of the lab time and then some more.

The deadlines are strict. If you're following the normal, 16-week schedule, you can find the deadline of each problem set at the top of it's description. (If you follow a non-standard schedule, discuss your deadlines with a teaching fellow beforehand.) Late word is not accepted, except in case of emergency. Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit outright.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the two.

Problem sets and the final project will be evaluated along the following axes:

* Scope

	Have you tried doing everything?

	0. empty or not submitted
	1. incomplete
	2. most of it is there, but a small part is missing
	3. you've done everything required
	4. you've tried some extras
	5. above and beyond: a real extra
	{: start="0"}

* Correctness

	Does your program do what is expected by a user?

	0. will not work at all
	1. takes too much time to get it working
	2. some problems, but we can fix them, probably a mistake
	3. it works, but not necessarily always the correct result
	4. correct results in all common cases of input
	5. perfection: always correct, even with erroneous input
	{: start="0"}

* Design

	How orderly is your code?

	0. we are unable to understand the structure
	1. lots of complex code and/or trying to avoid newly learned constructs
	2. too complicated, but you know your stuff
	3. straightforward code, could be put a bit inefficiently
	4. makes good use of the possibilities in the language
	5. perfection: you've read up on design and applied it to your code
	{: start="0"}

* Style

	How readable is your code?

	0. completely unreadable to us
	1. once or twice you did it right, but you should study the style guide
	2. you've read the style guide but haven't applied it consistently
	3. your code is readable and consistent, barring some minor problems
	4. the code is consistent, and only well-reasoned deviations from the guide
	5. perfection: you've made your own choices but maintained consistency
	{: start="0"}

## Walkthroughs

These discuss the current week's problem set. This is where you receive direction on where to begin and how to approach the week's challenges. Links to these video's are available within the problem set discriptions, so you should encounter them automatically as you progress through a particular problem set.

## Quizzes / Exams

The course has two 2-hour exams, both closed-book. We used to allow students to take some notes and a calculator to the exams, but **this is no longer the case**. To recap: you may only take a pen and pencil, nothing else, to these exams.

You are required to have studied the following components for these exams:

* Problem sets 0 through 5, inclusive, including all specification texts and walkthroughs belonging to these problem sets.
* Lectures 0 (Wednesday) through lecture 5 (Wednesday), inclusive.
* Sections 0 through 6, inclusive.
