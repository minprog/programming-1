# Programmeren 1

*Edition: September 2015 (v5.3) HI-SPEED*

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.

## Staff

The course's staff consists of your instructor and many student assistants. Due
to the size of the course, we can't usually respond to email inquiries about
your problem sets. You are encouraged to speak to an assistant or the
instructor at the lab.

## Prerequisites

This course is the first part of a two-course series aimed at students with
*little or no prior programming experience* but a desire to understand
computational approaches to problem solving.

## Expectations

You are expected to watch all lectures, attend all sections, submit five
problem sets, and take a quiz. You are also expected to attend a minimum amount
of lab sessions in order to get you moving quickly through the course.

## Grades

All students must ordinarily submit all five problem sets and take the quiz in
order to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in
writing by the course’s heads.

Problem sets and the final project are evaluated primarily along axes of scope,
correctness, design, and style, with scores ordinarily determined by scope × (3
× correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style). Scope is deemed all-important: we
strive for you to at least try every aspect of each problem set. Mid-semester
comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing.

Although you must submit all problem sets, your lowest score among those
problem sets on which you received perfect scores for the axis of scope will be
dropped when final grades are determined.

Know that this course draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those
less comfortable", "those more comfortable", and those somewhere in between.
However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up
relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself in Week 0.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are
not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Each student's final
grade is individually determined at term's end after input from the teaching
fellows. Remarkable effort and upward trending are always considered.

## Books

No books are required for this course. However, we do have a number of books
available for you to use in the lab. You are welcome to pick up one of
these and read them as a preparation for or review of one of the lectures.
