== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
  To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

All students must ordinarily submit this and all other problem sets to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

== Getting Ready

First, curl up with Jason's short on file I/O and Rob's short on structs.  Just keep in mind that Jason's short happens to focus on ASCII (i.e., text) files as opposed to binary files (like images). More on those later!

Next, join Nate on a tour of `valgrind`, a command-line tool that will help you find "memory leaks": memory that you've allocated (i.e., asked the operating system for), as with `malloc`, but not freed (i.e., given back to the operating system).

Finally, remind yourself how GDB works if you've forgotten or not yet used! (It's worth it!)

==  Getting Started

Welcome back!

As always, first open a terminal window and execute

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

to make sure your workspace is up-to-date.

Like Problem Set 3, this problem set comes with some distribution code that you'll need to download before getting started.  Go ahead and execute

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/workspace
----

in order to navigate to your `~/workspace` directory.  Then execute

[source,bash]
----
wget http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/4/pset4/pset4.zip
----

in order to download a ZIP (i.e., compressed version) of this problem set's distro.  If you then execute

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

you should see that you now have a file called `pset4.zip` in your `~/workspace` directory.  Unzip it by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
unzip pset4.zip
----

If you again execute

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

you should see that you now also have a `pset4` directory.  You're now welcome to delete the ZIP file with the below.

[source,bash]
----
rm -f pset4.zip
----

Now dive into that `pset4` directory by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
cd pset4
----

Now execute

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

and you should see that the directory contains the below.

[source,bash]
----
bmp/  jpg/  questions.txt
----

How fun! Two subdirectories and a file. Who knows what could be inside! Let's get started.

== whodunit

If you ever saw https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)[Windows XP's default wallpaper], then you've seen a BMP.  If you've ever looked at a webpage, you've probably seen a GIF.  If you've ever looked at a digital photo, you've probably seen a JPEG.  If you've ever taken a screenshot on a Mac, you've probably seen a PNG.  Read up online on the BMP, GIF, JPEG, and PNG file formats.   Then, open up `questions.txt` in `~/workspace/pset4` and tell us the below.

[start=0]
. How many different colors does each format support?
. Which of the formats supports animation?
. What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
. Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?

Next, curl up with the article from MIT at http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/4/garfinkel.pdf.

Though somewhat technical, you should find the article's language quite accessible.  Once you've read the article, answer each of the following questions in a sentence or more in `~/workspace/pset4/questions.txt`.

[start=4]
. What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
. What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?

Anyhow, welcome to Tudor Mansion.  Your host, Mr. John Boddy, has met an untimely endâ€”he's the victim of foul play.  To win this game, you must determine `whodunit`.

Unfortunately for you (though even more unfortunately for Mr. Boddy), the only evidence you have is a 24-bit BMP file called `clue.bmp`, pictured below, that Mr. Boddy whipped up on his computer in his final moments.   Hidden among this file's red "noise" is a drawing of `whodunit`.

image::clue.png[clue.bmp]

You long ago threw away that piece of red plastic from childhood that would solve this mystery for you, and so you must attack it as a computer scientist instead.

But, first, some background.

Perhaps the simplest way to represent an image is with a grid of pixels (i.e., dots), each of which can be of a different color.  For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white, as in the below.  (Image adapted from http://www.brackeen.com/vga/bitmaps.html[].)

image::grid.png[grid of pixels]

In this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits).  For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel.  A file format (like GIF) that supports "8-bit color" uses 8 bits per pixel.  A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports "24-bit color" uses 24 bits per pixel.  (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)

A 24-bit BMP like Mr. Boddy's uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel's color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel's color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel's color.  If you've ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.

If the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies "a lot of red," while 0x00 and 0x00 imply "no green" and "no blue," respectively.  Given how red Mr. Boddy's BMP is, it clearly has a lot of pixels with those RGB values.  But it also has a few with other values.

Incidentally, HTML and CSS (languages in which webpages can be written) model colors in this same way.  If curious, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors for more details.

Now let's get more technical.  Recall that a file is just a sequence of bits, arranged in some fashion.  A 24-bit BMP file, then, is essentially just a sequence of bits, (almost) every 24 of which happen to represent some pixel's color.  But a BMP file also contains some "metadata," information like an image's height and width.  That metadata is stored at the beginning of the file in the form of two data structures generally referred to as "headers" (not to be confused with C's header files).   (Incidentally, these headers have evolved over time.  This problem set only expects that you support version 4.0 (the latest) of Microsoft's BMP format, which debuted with Windows 95.)  The first of these headers, called `BITMAPFILEHEADER`, is 14 bytes long.  (Recall that 1 byte equals 8 bits.)  The second of these headers, called `BITMAPINFOHEADER`, is 40 bytes long.  Immediately following these headers is the actual bitmap: an array of bytes, triples of which represent a pixel's color.   (In 1-, 4-, and 16-bit BMPs, but not 24- or 32-, there's an additional header right after `BITMAPINFOHEADER` called `RGBQUAD`, an array that defines "intensity values" for each of the colors in a device's palette.)  However, BMP stores these triples backwards (i.e., as BGR), with 8 bits for blue, followed by 8 bits for green, followed by 8 bits for red.   (Some BMPs also store the entire bitmap backwards, with an image's top row at the end of the BMP file.  But we've stored this problem set's BMPs as described herein, with each bitmap's top row first and bottom row last.)  In other words, were we to convert the 1-bit smiley above to a 24-bit smiley, substituting red for black, a 24-bit BMP would store this bitmap as follows, where `0000ff` signifies red and `ffffff` signifies white; we've highlighted in red all instances of `0000ff`.

Because we've presented these bits from left to right, top to bottom, in 8 columns, you can actually see the red smiley if you take a step back.

To be clear, recall that a hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits.  Accordingly, `ffffff` in hexadecimal actually signifies `111111111111111111111111` in binary.

Okay, stop!  Don't proceed further until you're sure you understand why `0000ff` represents a red pixel in a 24-bit BMP file.

Okay, let's transition from theory to practice. Within CS50 IDE's file browser, expand (i.e., open via the small triangle) *pset4* and then *bmp*. Double-click *smiley.bmp*, and you should see a tiny smiley face that's only 8 pixels by 8 pixels. Via the drop-down menu in that file's newly opened tab, change *100%* to *400%* to zoom in a bit, and you should see a larger, albeit blurrier, version.  (So much for "enhance," huh?)  Actually, this particular image shouldn't really be blurry, even
when enlarged.  CS50 IDE is simply trying to be helpful (CSI-style) by "dithering" the image (i.e., by smoothing out its edges).  Below's what the smiley looks like if you zoom in without dithering.  At this zoom level, you can really see the image's pixels (as big squares).

image:smiley.png[smiley.png]

Okay, go ahead and return your attention to a terminal window, and navigate your way to `~/workspace/pset4/bmp`.  (Remember how?)  Let's look at the underlying bytes that compose `smiley.bmp` using `xxd`, a command-line "hex editor."  Execute:

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 24 -g 3 -s 54 smiley.bmp
----

You should see the below; we've again highlighted in red all instances of `0000ff`.

[source,subs=quotes]

In the leftmost column above are addresses within the file or, equivalently, offsets from the file's first byte, all of them given in hex.  Note that `00000036` in hexadecimal is `54` in decimal.  You're thus looking at byte `54` onward of `smiley.bmp`.  Recall that a 24-bit BMP's first 14 + 40 = 54 bytes are filled with metadata.  If you really want to see that metadata in addition to the bitmap, execute the command below.

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 24 -g 3 smiley.bmp
----

If `smiley.bmp` actually contained ASCII characters, you'd see them in ``xxd``'s rightmost column instead of all of those dots.

So, `smiley.bmp` is 8 pixels wide by 8 pixels tall, and it's a 24-bit BMP (each of whose pixels is represented with 24 Ã· 8 = 3 bytes).  Each row (aka "scanline") thus takes up (8 pixels) Ã— (3 bytes per pixel) = 24 bytes, which happens to be a multiple of 4.  It turns out that BMPs are stored a bit differently if the number of bytes in a scanline is not, in fact, a multiple of 4.  In `small.bmp`, for instance, is another 24-bit BMP, a green box that's 3 pixels wide by 3 pixels wide.  If you view it with Image Viewer (as by double-clicking it), you'll see that it resembles the below, albeit much smaller.  (Indeed,  you might need to zoom in again to see it.)

image:small.png[small.png]

Each scanline in `small.bmp` thus takes up (3 pixels) Ã— (3 bytes per pixel) = 9 bytes, which is not a multiple of 4.  And so the scanline is "padded" with as many zeroes as it takes to extend the scanline's length to a multiple of 4.  In other words, between 0 and 3 bytes of padding are needed for each scanline in a 24-bit BMP.  (Understand why?)  In the case of small.bmp, 3 bytes' worth of zeroes are needed, since (3 pixels) &#215; (3 bytes per pixel) + (3 bytes of padding) = 12 bytes, which is indeed a multiple of 4.

To "see" this padding, go ahead and run the below.

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 12 -g 3 -s 54 small.bmp
----

Note that we're using a different value for `-c` than we did for `smiley.bmp` so that `xxd` outputs only 4 columns this time (3 for the green box and 1 for the padding).  You should see output like the below; we've highlighted in green all instances of `00ff00`.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
    0000036: [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# 000000  ............
    0000042: [green]#00ff00# ffffff [green]#00ff00# 000000  ............
    000004e: [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# 000000  ............
----

For contrast, let's use `xxd` on `large.bmp`, which looks identical to `small.bmp` but, at 12 pixels by 12 pixels, is four times as large.  Go ahead and execute the below; you may need to widen your window to avoid wrapping.

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 36 -g 3 -s 54 large.bmp
----

You should see output like the below; we've again highlighted in green all instances of `00ff00`

Worthy of note is that this BMP lacks padding!  After all, (12 pixels) Ã— (3 bytes per pixel) = 36 bytes is indeed a multiple of 4.

Knowing all this has got to be useful!

Okay, `xxd` only showed you the bytes in these BMPs.  How do we actually get at them programmatically?  Well, in `copy.c` is a program whose sole purpose in life is to create a copy of a BMP, piece by piece.  Of course, you could just use `cp` for that.  But `cp` isn't going to help Mr. Boddy.  Let's hope that `copy.c` does!

Go ahead and compile `copy.c` into a program called `copy` using `make`.  (Remember how?)  Then execute a command like the below.

[source,bash]
----
./copy smiley.bmp copy.bmp
----

If you then execute ls (with the appropriate switch), you should see that `smiley.bmp` and `copy.bmp` are indeed the same size.  Let's double-check that they're actually the same!  Execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
diff smiley.bmp copy.bmp
----

If that command tells you nothing, the files are indeed identical.  (Note that some programs, like Photoshop, include trailing zeroes at the ends of some BMPs.  Our version of `copy` throws those away, so don't be too worried if you try to copy a BMP that you've downloaded or made only to find that the copy is actually a few bytes smaller than the original.)  Feel free to open both files in Ristretto Image Viewer (as by double-clicking each) to confirm as much visually.  But diff does a byte-by-byte comparison, so its eye is probably sharper than yours!

So how now did that copy get made?  It turns out that `copy.c` relies on `bmp.h`.  Let's take a look.  Open up `bmp.h`, and you'll see actual definitions of those headers we've mentioned, adapted from Microsoft's own implementations thereof.  In addition, that file defines `BYTE`, `DWORD`, `LONG`, and `WORD`, data types normally found in the world of Win32 (i.e., Windows) programming.  Notice how they're just aliases for primitives with which you are (hopefully) already familiar.  It appears that `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` make use of these types.  This file also defines a `struct` called `RGBTRIPLE` that, quite simply, "encapsulates" three bytes: one blue, one green, and one red (the order, recall, in which we expect to find RGB triples actually on disk).

Why are these `struct`pass:[s] useful?  Well, recall that a file is just a sequence of bytes (or, ultimately, bits) on disk.  But those bytes are generally ordered in such a way that the first few represent something, the next few represent something else, and so on.  "File formats" exist because the world has standardized what bytes mean what.  Now, we could just read a file from disk into RAM as one big array of bytes.  And we could just remember that the byte at location `[i]` represents one thing, while the byte at location `[j]` represents another.  But why not give some of those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily?  That's precisely what the ``struct``s in `bmp.h` allow us to do.  Rather than think of some file as one long sequence of bytes, we can instead think of it as a sequence of `struct`s.

Recall that `smiley.bmp` is 8 by 8 pixels, and so it should take up 14 + 40 + (8 Ã— 8) Ã— 3 = 246 bytes on disk.  (Confirm as much if you'd like using `ls`.)  Here's what it thus looks like on disk according to Microsoft:

image:disk.png[smiley.bmp on disk]

As this figure suggests, order does matter when it comes to ``struct``s' members.  Byte 57 is `rgbtBlue` (and not, say, `rgbtRed`), because `rgbtBlue` is defined first in `RGBTRIPLE`.  Our use, incidentally, of the `__attribute__` called `__packed__` ensures that `clang` does not try to "word-align" members (whereby the address of each member's first byte is a multiple of 4), lest we end up with "gaps" in our `struct`s that don't actually exist on disk. 

Now go ahead and pull up the URLs to which `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` are attributed, per the comments in `bmp.h`.  You're about to start using MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network)!

Rather than hold your hand further on a stroll through `copy.c`, we're instead going to ask you some questions and let you teach yourself how the code therein works.  As always, `man` is your friend, and so, now, is MSDN.  If not sure on first glance how to answer some question, do some quick research and figure it out!  You might want to turn to *stdio.h* at https://reference.cs50.net/ as well.

Allow us to suggest that you also run `copy` within GDB while answering these questions as follows:

. Click *Debug* atop CS50 IDE, which should open a new terminal window (toward the bottom of CS50 IDE) for GDB.
. To the right of *Command:* within that terminal, you should see `pset4/bmp/copy.c` in a text box. To run `copy` within GDB with command-line arguments, change the contents of that text box to be, e.g., `copy.c smiley.bmp copy.bmp`.
. Set a breakpoint within `main` (as by clicking to the left of the line number for `main`).
. Then click *Run* (or *Stop* and then *Run*) within GDB's terminal window and step through the program via GDB's righthand panel, keeping an eye on `bf` and `bi` in particular.

In `~/workspace/pset4/questions.txt`, answer each of the following questions in a sentence or more.

[start=6]
. What's `stdint.h`?
. What's the point of using `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint16_t` in a program?
. How many bytes is a `BYTE`, a `DWORD`, a `LONG`, and a `WORD`, respectively?
. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?  (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
. What's the difference between `bfSize` and `biSize`?
. What does it mean if `biHeight` is negative?
. What field in `BITMAPINFOHEADER` specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
. Why might `fopen` return `NULL` in `copy.c:37`?
. Why is the third argument to `fread` always `1` in our code?
. What value does `copy.c:70` assign `padding` if `bi.biWidth` is `3`?
. What does `fseek` do?
. What is `SEEK_CUR`?

Okay, back to Mr. Boddy.

Write a program called `whodunit` in a file called `whodunit.c` that reveals Mr. Boddy's drawing.  

Ummm, what?

Well, think back to childhood when you held that piece of red plastic over similarly hidden messages.   (If you remember no such piece of plastic, best to ask a classmate about his or her childhood.)  Essentially, the plastic turned everything red but somehow revealed those messages.  Implement that same idea in `whodunit`.  Like `copy`, your program should accept exactly two command-line arguments.  And if you execute a command like the below, stored in `verdict.bmp` should be a BMP in which Mr. Boddy's drawing is no longer covered with noise.

[source,bash]
----
./whodunit clue.bmp verdict.bmp
----
   
Allow us to suggest that you begin tackling this mystery by executing the command below.

[source,bash]
----
cp copy.c whodunit.c
----

Wink wink.  You may be amazed by how few lines of code you actually need to write in order to help Mr. Boddy.

There's nothing hidden in `smiley.bmp`, but feel free to test your program out on its pixels nonetheless, if only because that BMP is small and you can thus compare it and your own program's output with `xxd` during development.  (Or maybe there is a message hidden in `smiley.bmp` too.  No, there's not.)

Rest assured that more than one solution is possible.  So long as Mr. Boddy's drawing is identifiable (by you), no matter its legibility, Mr. Boddy will rest in peace.

Because `whodunit` can be implemented in several ways, you won't be able to check your implementation's correctness with `check50`.  And, lest it spoil your fun, the staff's solution to `whodunit` is not available.

But here is Zamyla!

In `~/workspace/pset4/questions.txt`, answer the question below.

[start=18]
. Whodunit?

== resize

Well that was fun.  Bit late for Mr. Boddy, though.

Alright, next challenge!  Implement now in `resize.c` a program called `resize` that resizes 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of `n`.  Your program should accept exactly three command-line arguments, per the below usage, whereby the first (`n`) must be a positive integer less than or equal to 100, the second the name of the file to be resized, and the third the name of the resized version to be written.

[source,bash]
----
Usage: ./resize n infile outfile
----

With a program like this, we could have created `large.bmp` out of `small.bmp` by resizing the latter by a factor of 4 (i.e., by multiplying both its width and its height by 4), per the below. 

[source,bash]
----
./resize 4 small.bmp large.bmp
----

You're welcome to get started by copying (yet again) `copy.c` and naming the copy `resize.c`.  But spend some time thinking about what it means to resize a BMP.  (You may assume that `n` times the size of `infile` will not exceed 2^32^ - 1.)  Decide which of the fields in `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` you might need to modify.  Consider whether or not you'll need to add or subtract padding to scanlines.  And be thankful that we don't expect you to support fractional `n` between 0 and 1!  (As we do in the Hacker Edition!)  But we do expect you to support a value of `1` for `n`, the result of which should be an `outfile` with dimensions identical to ``infile``'s.

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
check50 2015.fall.pset4.resize bmp.h resize.c
----

If you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `resize`, you may execute the below.   

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/pset4/resize
----

If you'd like to peek at, e.g., ``large.bmp``'s headers (in a more user-friendly way than `xxd` allows), you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/pset4/peek large.bmp
----

Better yet, if you'd like to compare your outfile's headers against the staff's, you might want to execute commands like the below while inside your `~/workspace/pset4/bmp` directory.  (Think about what each is doing.)

[source,bash]
----
./resize 4 small.bmp student.bmp
~cs50/pset4/resize 4 small.bmp staff.bmp
~cs50/pset4/peek student.bmp staff.bmp
----

If you happen to use `malloc`, be sure to use `free` so as not to leak memory. Try using `valgrind` to check for any leaks!

Here's Zamyla again!

== recover

Alright, now let's put all your new skills to the test.

In anticipation of this problem set, I spent the past several days snapping photos of people I know, all of which were saved by my digital camera as JPEGs on a 1GB CompactFlash (CF) card.  (It's possible I actually spent the past several days on Facebook instead.)  Unfortunately, I'm not very good with computers, and I somehow deleted them all!  Thankfully, in the computer world, "deleted" tends not to mean "deleted" so much as "forgotten."  My computer insists that the CF card is now blank, but I'm pretty sure it's lying to me.

Write in `~/workspace/pset4/jpg/recover.c` a program that recovers these photos.

Ummm.

Okay, here's the thing.  Even though JPEGs are more complicated than BMPs, JPEGs have "signatures," patterns of bytes that can distinguish them from other file formats. Specifically, the first three bytes of JPEGs are 

[source,bash]
----
0xff 0xd8 0xff
----

from first byte to third byte, left to right. The fourth byte, meanwhile, is either `0xe0`, `0xe1`, `0xe2`, `0xe3`, `0xe4`, `0xe5`, `0xe6`, `0xe7`, `0xe8`, `0xe8`, `0xe9`, `0xea`, `0xeb`, `0xec`, `0xed`, `0xee`, of `0xef`. Put another way, the fourth byte's first four bits are `1110`.

Odds are, if you find this pattern of four bytes on a disk known to store photos (e.g., my CF card), they demark the start of a JPEG.  (To be sure, you might encounter these patterns on some disk purely by chance, so data recovery isn't an exact science.)

Fortunately, digital cameras tend to store photographs contiguously on CF cards, whereby each photo is stored immediately after the previously taken photo.  Accordingly, the start of a JPEG usually demarks the end of another.  However, digital cameras generally initialize CF cards with a FAT file system whose "block size" is 512 bytes (B).  The implication is that these cameras only write to those cards in units of 512 B.  A photo that's 1 MB (i.e., 1,048,576 B) thus takes up 1048576 Ã· 512 = 2048 "blocks" on a CF card.  But so does a photo that's, say, one byte smaller (i.e., 1,048,575 B)!  The wasted space on disk is called "slack space."  Forensic investigators often look at slack space for remnants of suspicious data.

The implication of all these details is that you, the investigator, can probably write a program that iterates over a copy of my CF card, looking for JPEGs' signatures.  Each time you find a signature, you can open a new file for writing and start filling that file with bytes from my CF card, closing that file only once you encounter another signature.  Moreover, rather than read my CF card's bytes one at a time, you can read 512 of them at a time into a buffer for efficiency's sake.  Thanks to FAT, you can trust that JPEGs' signatures will be "block-aligned."  That is, you need only look for those signatures in a block's first four bytes. 

Realize, of course, that JPEGs can span contiguous blocks.  Otherwise, no JPEG could be larger than 512 B.  But the last byte of a JPEG might not fall at the very end of a block.  Recall the possibility of slack space.  But not to worry.  Because this CF card was brand-new when I started snapping photos, odds are it'd been "zeroed" (i.e., filled with 0s) by the manufacturer, in which case any slack space will be filled with 0s.  It's okay if those trailing 0s end up in the JPEGs you recover; they should still be viewable.

Now, I only have one CF card, but there are a whole lot of you!  And so I've gone ahead and created a "forensic image" of the card, storing its contents, byte after byte, in a file called `card.raw`.  So that you don't waste time iterating over millions of 0s unnecessarily, I've only imaged the first few megabytes of the CF card.  But you should ultimately find that the image contains 50 JPEGs.  As usual, you can open the file programmatically with `fopen`, as in the below.  

[source,c]
----
FILE* file = fopen("card.raw", "r");
----

Notice, incidentally, that `~/workspace/pset4/jpg` contains only `recover.c`, but it's devoid of any code.  (We leave it to you to decide how to implement and compile `recover`!)   For simplicity, you should hard-code `"card.raw"` in your program; your program need not accept any command-line arguments.  When executed, though, your program should recover every one of the JPEGs from `card.raw`, storing each as a separate file in your current working directory.  Your program should number the files it outputs by naming each `pass:[###].jpg`, where `pass:[###]` is three-digit decimal number from `000` on up.  (Befriend `sprintf`.)  You need not try to recover the JPEGs' original names.  To check whether the JPEGs your program spit out are correct, simply double-click and take a look!  If each photo appears intact, your operation was likely a success!

Odds are, though, the JPEGs that the first draft of your code spits out won't be correct.  (If you open them up and don't see anything, they're probably not correct!)  Execute the command below to delete all JPEGs in your current working directory.

[source,bash]
----
rm *.jpg
----
   
If you'd rather not be prompted to confirm each deletion, execute the command below instead.

[source,bash]
----
rm -f *.jpg
----

Just be careful with that `-f` switch, as it "forces" deletion without prompting you.

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
check50 2015.fall.pset4.recover recover.c
----

Lest it spoil your (forensic) fun, the staff's solution to `recover` is not available.

As before, if you happen to use `malloc`, be sure to use `free` so as not to leak memory. Try using `valgrind` to check for any leaks!

== Sanity Checks

Before you consider this problem set done, best to ask yourself these questions and then go back and improve your code as needed!  Do not consider the below an exhaustive list of expectations, though, just some helpful reminders.  The checkboxes that have come before these represent the exhaustive list!  To be clear, consider the questions below rhetorical.  No need to answer them in writing for us, since all of your answers should be "yes!"

* Did you fill `questions.txt` with answers to all questions?
* Is the BMP that `whodunit` outputs legible (to you)?
* Does `resize` accept three and only three command-line arguments?
* Does `resize` ensure that `n` is in [1, 100]?
* Does `resize` update `bfSize`, `biHeight`, `biSizeImage`, and `biWidth` correctly?
* Does `resize` add or remove padding as needed?
* Are you sure that `resize` doesn't have any memory leaks?
* Does `recover` output 50 JPEGs?  Are all 50 viewable?
* Does `recover` name the JPEGs `pass:[###].jpg`, where `pass:[###]` is a three-digit number from `000` through `049`?
* Are you sure that `recover` doesn't have any memory leaks?
* Are all of your files where they should be in `~/workspace/pset4`?

As always, if you can't answer "yes" to one or more of the above because you're having some trouble, do drop by office hours or turn to https://cs50.net/discuss[CS50 Discuss]!

== Fabulous Prizes

And now the real fun begins. You are hereby challenged to find as many of the computer scientists featured in these photos as possible.  To prove that you found someone, take a photo of yourself posing (anywhere) with the computer scientist (in such a way that he or she is aware of the photo and not just in the background). If a photo contains multiple computer scientists, you're welcome to pose with each of them separately. Upload your photos (i.e., the photos you took, not the ones that you
recovered) to a non-private album somewhere that supports bulk downloads (e.g., workspace, Imgur, etc.), then email your album's URL to selfies@cs50.net by *noon on Mon 10/19*! We'll add your photos to a public gallery (unless you request otherwise).

For each (hey, that's a loop) of the computer scientists you find, we'll set you up with 1GB of Dropbox space! In other words, if you snag _n_ selfies, we'll send you _n_ GB of Dropbox space (thanks to a former head TF who's now at Dropbox)! (Though supplies may be limited.)

Moreover, whoever finds and photographs the most computer scientists (and, in the event of a tie, submits first) shall be rewarded with a little something extra.

This was Problem Set 4.
