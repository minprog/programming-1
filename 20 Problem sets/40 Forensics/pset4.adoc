= Problem Set 4: Forensics

== tl;dr
 
. Watch https://video.cs50.net/2016/fall/lectures/4[Week 4's lecture].
. Figure out whodunit.
. Resize some images.
. Recover some photos.
. Submit your code.
. Submit a form.

== Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and execute

[source]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. 

Next, execute

[source]
----
mkdir ~/workspace/pset4/
----

at your prompt in order to make a directory called `pset4` in your `workspace` directory.

Now execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset4/
----

and your prompt should resemble the below.

[source]
----
~/workspace/pset4/ $
----

== What to Do

. Implement link:/problems/whodunit[Whodunit]
. Implement either of:
+
--
* link:/problems/resize-less[Resize], less comfortable
* link:/problems/resize-more[Resize], more comfortable
--
+
. Implement link:/problems/recover[Recover]

== Fabulous Prize

And now the real fun begins. You are hereby challenged to find as many of the computer scientists featured in the photos that you recovered for link:../../../../problems/recover/recover.html[Recover] as possible. To prove that you found someone, take a photo of yourself posing (anywhere) with the computer scientist (in such a way that he or she is aware of the photo and not just in the background). If a photo contains multiple computer scientists, you're welcome to pose with each of them separately. Upload your photos (i.e., the photos you took, not the ones that you recovered) to a non-private album somewhere that supports bulk downloads (e.g., Dropbox, Imgur, etc.), then email your album's URL to selfies@cs50.net by *noon on Mon 10/10*! We'll add your photos to a public gallery (unless you request otherwise).

Whoever finds and photographs the most computer scientists (and, in the event of a tie, submits first) shall be rewarded with a fabulous prize.

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 2

* Update your IDE:

----
cd ~/workspace/pset4/whodunit/
submit50 whodunit
----
* Submit `resize`:
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset4/resize/
submit50 resize
----
* Submit `recover`:
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset4/recover/
submit50 recover
----
