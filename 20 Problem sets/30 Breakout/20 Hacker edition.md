Please go to [this web page](http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/fall/psets/3/hacker3/hacker3.html) to do the hacker edition. Don't forget to come back here to submit your problems!

## How to submit

When ready to submit, open up a Terminal window and navigate your way to **~/Dropbox**. Create a ZIP (i.e., compressed) file containing your entire **pset3** directory by executing the below. Incidentally, **-r** means "recursive," which in this case means to ZIP up everything inside of pset3, including any subdirectories (or even subsubdirectories!).

    zip -r pset3.zip pset3

If you type **ls** thereafter, you should see that you have a new file called **pset3.zip** in **~/Dropbox**. (If you realize later that you need to make a change to some file and re-ZIP everything, you can delete the ZIP file you already made with **rm pset3.zip**, then create a new ZIP file as before.)

To submit, please upload **pset3.zip** at the bottom of the page.

If you'd like to re-submit different (or modified) files, simply return to this page and repeat these steps. You may re-submit as many times as you'd like; we'll grade your most recent submission, so long as it's before the deadline.

This was Problem Set 3.
