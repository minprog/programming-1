# What to submit?
Answer the questions below and collect your answers in a .pdf called multimedia.pdf. Be sure to include your name and studentnumber!

# Questions

## 1. \#C0FFEE
1. (2 points) Why do filenames have extensions? Does a file need to have an extension to be opened?
Why or why not?

2. (3 points) What’s the difference between additive and subtractive color mixing? Give an example
of a set of primary colors that can be used for each.

3. (2 points) What is the color depth of a black-and-white, monochrome image?

4. (3 points) What colors do the following color codes (given in RGB) represent?
	1. \#F08080
	2. \#B0E0E6
	3. \#C0FFEE

## 2. New Year's Resolution
5. (3 points) Why might a website want to create both low-resolution and high-resolution versions
of its logo? What are the advantages of a low resolution logo, and what are the advantages of a high
resolution logo?

6. (3 points) What’s the difference between lossless compression and lossy compression? Give an
example of a file format that uses each.

7. (2 points) Why is it that vector graphics scale to larger sizes so nicely, but raster graphics do not?

## 3. Sound Off
8. (2 points) How do amplitude and frequency affect sound?

9. (3 points) Describe the process of converting from analog sound to digital. How do both sampling
rate and bitrate come into play in this process, and what’s the difference between the two?

10. (2 points) I have an audiophile friend who just spent another $100 on a new hard drive because
he refuses to listen to anything but PCM audio. He says he can always tell the difference between
PCM and MP3. Even though MP3 ŀles are a fraction of the size of their CD-quality equivalents,
why might my friend be going a bit overboard?

## 4. Another Dimension
11. (2 points) What’s a wireframe? Describe how we use wireframes to represent objects in 3D
space.

12. (2 points) Homer went to download a mesh of a doughnut, but the file he downloaded looks
more like a box. D’oh! Lisa says that he shouldn’t worry, though, because the mesh he downloaded
will work just fine. Why?

13. (3 points) What’s the difference between a container and a codec? Give an example of each.

## 5. Graphic Designer
14. (4 points) Try seam carving some of your own photos! It’s really cool. If you don’t have
any photos of your own, feel free to download some from the Internet. Content-aware scaling
is available in both Photoshop (http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and as a plugin
for the GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/), but you can also just download the Seam Carving GUI
(https://code.google.com/p/seam-carving-gui/). Images with lots of empty space in the horizontal
or vertical directions will produce the best results. Submit both the original photo and the seam
carved version, and try to scale the image by at least 10% of its original width or height. In a short
paragraph, tell us about your experience! Which parts of your image(s) had low energy?

15. (5 points) Now, it’s time to create some multimedia of your own! First, you’ll want to download
Photoshop, GIMP, or any other image editor of your choice. If you’ve never done graphic design
before, check out this week’s section videos, available at http://cse1.net/sections. There are lots of
free Photoshop and GIMP tutorials on the web as well!

	Now, let’s make an E-1 souvenir! Design a graphic inspired by E-1 that is suitable for print on
a T-shirt, mug, or any of the products listed at http://www.cafepress.com/make/personalized-gifts.
For example, you might want to create a fancy logo, a clever pun, or something along the lines of “I
Survived Computer Science E-1!” Once you’ve come up with an idea, read the Cafepress Beginner’s
Tutorial at http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/index.aspx?page=images.aspx, and check out
the starter files at http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/sell/index.aspx?area=images&page=help_templates
to get a sense of how large your image should be.

	Submit both your original file (as a .PSD or .XCF), as well as a .PNG. In a short paragraph, tell us
about your design and your experience making it! Next week, we’ll compile everyone’s submissions
into a gallery, and you’ll be able to purchase items designed by you and your classmates! If you’d
prefer that we don’t upload your image to Cafepress or you wish to remain anonymous, that’s totally fine!
Just let us know on your problem set submission.

	If you’d like to create something that mimics the course’s own design, E-1’s main heading font
is League Gothic, the subtitle font is Sorts Mill Goudy, and the body font is Adobe Caslon Pro.
