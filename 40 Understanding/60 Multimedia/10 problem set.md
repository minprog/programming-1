# What to submit?

Answer the questions below and collect your answers in a `.pdf` called `multimedia.pdf`. Be sure to include your name and student ID!

# Questions

## 1. \#C0FFEE

1. Why do filenames have extensions? Does a file need to have an extension to
be opened? Why or why not?

2. What's the difference between additive and subtractive color mixing? Give an
example of a set of primary colors that can be used for each.

3. What is the color depth of a black-and-white, monochrome image?

4. What colors do the following color codes (given in RGB) represent?

	1. `#F08080`
	2. `#B0E0E6`
	3. `#C0FFEE`

## 2. New Year's Resolution

5. Why might a website want to create both low-resolution and high-resolution
versions of its logo? What are the advantages of a low resolution logo, and
what are the advantages of a high resolution logo?

6. What's the difference between lossless compression and lossy compression?
Give an example of a file format that uses each.

7. Why is it that vector graphics scale to larger sizes so nicely, but raster
graphics do not?

## 3. Sound Off

8. How do amplitude and frequency affect sound?

9. Describe the process of converting from analog sound to digital. How do both
sampling rate and bitrate come into play in this process, and what's the
difference between the two?

10. I have an audiophile friend who just spent another $100 on a new hard drive
because he refuses to listen to anything but PCM audio. He says he can always
tell the difference between PCM and MP3. Even though MP3 files are a fraction
of the size of their CD-quality equivalents, why might my friend be going a bit
overboard?

## 4. Another Dimension

11. What's a wireframe? Describe how we use wireframes to represent objects in
3D space.

12. Homer went to download a mesh of a doughnut, but the file he downloaded
looks more like a box. D'oh! Lisa says that he shouldn't worry, though, because
the mesh he downloaded will work just fine. Why?

13. What's the difference between a container and a codec? Give an example of
each.

## 5. Graphic Designer

14. Try seam carving some of your own photos! It's really cool. If you don't
have any photos of your own, feel free to download some from the Internet.
Content-aware scaling is available in both Photoshop
(<http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html>) and as a plugin for the GIMP
(<http://www.gimp.org/>), but you can also just download the Seam Carving GUI
(<https://code.google.com/p/seam-carving-gui/>). Images with lots of empty space
in the horizontal or vertical directions will produce the best results. Submit
both the original photo and the seam carved version, and try to scale the image
by at least 10% of its original width or height. In a short paragraph, tell us
about your experience! Which parts of your image(s) had low energy?
