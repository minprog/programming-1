# What to submit?
Answer the questions below and collect your answers in a .pdf called internet.pdf. Be sure to include your name and studentnumber!

# Questions

## 1. Route 66
1. Recall that sites like http://en.dnstools.ch/visual-traceroute.html and http://traceroute.monitis.com
let you run traceroute from within your browser! In approximately which geographic location are
each of the following sites hosted? What is an IP address associated with each of these sites?
	1. cse1.net
	2. mcdonalds.com
	3. mlb.com

2. What’s an IP address? What’s the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? What does it
mean for IPv6 to be necessary?

3. Based on the maps above, it looks like many requests take a very roundabout path
to their destination. Why might this be the case? Do all routers know how to get to every IP
address on the Internet?

## 2. Private Eye-P
4. What’s the difference between a public IP and a private IP? What are some common
prefixes for private IP addresses?

5. My computer is on a network using NAT. What can you say about my computer’s IP
address? How does a server’s response make its way back to my computer?

6. How does your computer acquire an IP address on a network using DHCP?

## 3. Speed Racer
7. Let’s test the Internet connection you have at home or at work. First, what are the
download and upload speeds of your connection, according to your ISP? Now, using http://www.speedtest.net
or http://www.whatismyip.com/speed-test, what are the actual download and upload speeds of your
Internet connection? Is there a difference between what your ISP reports and what the tests report?

## 4. A System for Domains
8. Why is it important that root DNS servers are kept secure? What could happen if
one were ever compromised?

9. What’s the difference between an A record and a CNAME record? When might
you want to use one over the other?

10. When you change DNS record, there’s a good chance the change in your domain or
subdomain won’t be redirected immediately when you access the Internet. Why not?

11. I’m lucky enough to say that my initials are a recognized TLD! (I’ll have to fly to
Turkmenistan to thank them someday.) Can you say the same for your initials?

## 5. Debate Team
12. Let’s talk about net neutrality. If you’re unfamiliar with the topic, you might want to
curl up with some readings like http://theopeninter.net, http://www.scientificcamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longlive-
the-web, and http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/huge-isps-want-per-gb-paymentsfrom-
netflix-youtube.ars. In a short paragraph, tell us where you stand on the issue and why! To
get you thinking, consider how net neutrality affects economics, freedom, and fairness from an Internet
user’s perspective!

13. Why might a company like Google or Facebook want to expose its data via an
API?

## 6. Putting it All Together
14. You just typed http://youtu.be/C_S5cXbXe-4 into your web browser’s address bar
and hit Enter, at which point a YouTube video appears on a page. In a technically detailed paragraph,
what happened? You can assume that you are indeed connected to the Internet and that
URL points to a valid page on YouTube (which it does, so you should click it). Your response
should reference terms like routers and DNS!
