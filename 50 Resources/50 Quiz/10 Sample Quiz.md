## Quiz

The course has one 75-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.

Anything in lectures from weeks 0 through 5 can be on the quiz. So best to review all lecture notes! But a lot more tips on studying are in this review session:

Also, to prepare well, you might have a try at a quiz from previous years:

Finally, if in trouble on a particular topic, there is [CS50 Study](https://study.cs50.net), which has an overview of many important parts of the course and links to all relevant materials on each topic.
