## Quiz

The course has one 90-minute quiz. It is "closed-book." You may utilize during each quiz a pen or pencil, nothing else.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.

Anything in lectures from weeks 0 through 5 can be on the quiz. So best to review all lecture notes! But a lot more tips on studying are in this review session:

(Ignore anything from linked lists onward!)

Finally, if in trouble on a particular topic, there is [CS50 Study](https://study.cs50.net), which has an overview of many important parts of the course and links to all relevant materials on each topic.
