## Sample Quiz

The course has one 75-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.

You are required to have studied the following components for these exams:

* Problem sets 0 (Scratch) through 3 (Fifteen), including all specification texts and walkthroughs belonging to these problem sets.
* Lectures 0 (Wednesday) through lecture 4 (Wednesday).
* Sections 1, 2 and 3.

The quiz is not about any of the "Understanding computers and the internet" videos, although some of the topics in those videos do appear in the CS50 lectures; these can indeed be part of the quiz.
