* You can find everything you need to know about the CS50 Appliance [here](https://manual.cs50.net/appliance/19/). **Note that we use version 19!** Other versions will not work.

* For convencience, the link to download VMWare Player is [here](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0) and the link to download the CS50 Appliance 19 image is [here](http://mirror.cs50.net/appliance50/19/i386/appliance50-19-vmware.ova).

* Users with a MacBook that's running OS X should use VMWare Fusion instead (they can use the same Appliance image, though). A free licence can be obtained by mailing help@mprog.nl.
