* You can find everything you need to know about the CS50 Appliance [here](https://manual.cs50.net/appliance/19/#how_to_install_appliance). *Note that we use version 19!* Other versions will not work.

* Users with a MacBook that's running OS X should use VMWare Fusion instead (they can use the same Appliance image, though). A free licence can be obtained by mailing help@mprog.nl.
