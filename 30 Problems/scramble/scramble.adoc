== Background

Scramble wasfootnote:[The game is probably more commonly known--as of this writing--as "Word Streak with Friends".] a game, popular on smartphones, that challenges you to find as many words as possible in a 4x4 grid of letters before a timer expires. Each pair of letters in a word can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Below, for instance, is what the modern version of the game looks like on an Android phone.

Present are words like `THIS`, `SING`, `GEAR`, `HIS`, `RED`, along with many other words.

=== Understanding

Notice first that atop `scramble.c` are a bunch of constants. Take note of the comments above each. Recall that declaring as constants values that you intend to use multiple times throughout
your code tends to be good practice, so that you can change the value as needed in a single place.

Next, below those constants are some global variables. Global variables tend to be frowned upon (because there's usually a cleaner way to achieve some goal). But when the sole purpose of a file is to implement some program, as is the case here with `scramble.c`, it's not unreasonable to use globals to avoid passing around particularly important values again and again among several functions. For instance, we've declared `grid` as a global simply because so many functions will need access to it anyway, as you'll eventually see.

Notice next how we've utilized `typedef` and `struct` (both of which are quite new!) to declare our very own data type called `word`, inside of which is a `bool` and an array. We'll use a whole bunch of those structures in order to keep track of the words in that dictionary you downloaded (and whether the user has found them on the grid). Soon enough, we'll learn more about the `struct` keyword and how to create our own data types. For now, take for granted that it's possible, and consider it a sneak preview of things to come.

Below `word`, meanwhile, is `dictionary`, which we've declared as a `struct` without using `typedef`. The result is that this program will have just one `dictionary` structure, inside of which is an `int` and an array of many elements of type `word`.

Consider the prototypes below `dictionary` a sneak preview of the functions to come!

Incidentally, take care not to change any code related to `logfile`, which we use to automate some tests of your code!

Next read through `main`, focusing first on the comments and then on the code. If unsure at first glance what some line does, take some time to figure it out. It'll be a lot easier to write new
code if you understand the code that's already there! If unfamiliar with some function, try to find it on CS50 Reference, else consult its "man page."

For instance, to pull up the manual for `atoi`, execute the below.footnote:[On occasion, you may need to execute `man 2 function` or `man 3 function`, where `function` is some function's name, lest you pull up the manual for a Linux command as opposed to a C function. For instance, the `man` page for C's `printf` is in (chapter) 3 and not 1, which is the default if you don't specify a chapter explicitly.]

[source,bash]

man atoi

Notice, incidentally, how we're utilizing some "ANSI color codes" in main in order to output red text when the game's timer expires. They're a bit cryptic, to be sure, but pretty easy to use. See http://pueblo.sourceforge.net/doc/manual/ansi_color_codes.html[this link] for other colors.

Also, while debugging your program, you might want to comment out the call to `clear` in `main` so that you can see everything printed by `printf`, without anything disappearing.

Next read through each of the functions below `main`. In particular, make an effort to understand what is happening in `find` and `crawl`. It turns out that `crawl` implements a
"recursive" algorithm (whereby `crawl` calls itself) that searches the grid horizontally, vertically, and diagonally for a particular word, "marking" letters temporarily as it visits them so that it doesn't accidentally get caught in an infinite loop.

Meanwhile, `initialize` might look a bit intimidating, but spend some time figuring out how it goes about initializing the grid with a distribution of letters. The `man` page for `rand` (albeit a bit cryptic itself) might help you figure out all the arithmetic.

Finally, `load` should have some somewhat familiar syntax, particularly `FILE`. We'll revisit `FILE` and more in the weeks to come. For now, know that `load` simply loads a whole bunch of words, one per line, from a file into an array.

== Specification

* Complete the implementation of `draw` (using some loops and `printf`) in such a way that `grid[i][j]` represents the letter in row `i`, column `j`. You're welcome to stray from the aesthetics of the staff's own solution if you choose.
* Complete the implementation of `lookup` in such a way that the function returns `true` if and only if `word` is in `dictionary`. Odds are you can do better than linear search. Be sure to also mark the word's `found` attribute to be `true` also, to prevent users from scoring the same word multiple times!
* Complete the implementation of `scramble` (the function) in such a way that the grid is **rotated** 90 degrees clockwise anytime the user types ``SCRAMBLE``, per the comments therein.  Note that this feature doesn't affect the words in the grid; it simply lets the user see them from different perspective.
* By default, the distribution code makes it so that if you find an _n_-letter word, you score _n_ points. Create a new function called `score` to instead have the user to score points according to the following table. You will, of course, also have to alter `main` to call your new `score` function when awarding the user points.

|===
| Word Length | Points

| 1, 2, or 3 | 1 point
| 4 | 2 points
| 5 | 4 points
| 6 | 8 points
| 7 or more | 16 points
|===

* By default, the distribution code is case-sensitive, whereby if `FOO` is in dictionary, the user must type `FOO`, not `foo`, in order to score. Alter `main` in such a way that the user can
type `FOO` or `foo` (or even `FoO` or any other capitalization thereof) in order to score.

== Hints

Remember to take "baby steps." Don't try to bite off the entire game at once. Instead, implement one function at a time and be sure that it works before forging ahead. Any design decisions not explicitly prescribed herein (e.g., how much space you should leave between numbers when printing the board) are intentionally left to you. Presumably the board, when printed, should look something like that when executing the staff solution, but we leave it to you to implement your own vision.

You're welcome to write your own functions and even change the prototypes of functions we wrote. But you may not alter the flow of logic in `main` itself so that we can automate some tests of your program once submitted.

== Testing

To test your implementation of `scramble`, try playing it. (Know that you can force your program to quit by hitting ctrl-c.) Be sure that you (and we) cannot crash your program, as by providing bogus words.
